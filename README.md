# RefWeak
A list of weak Bacterial assemblies in GenBank. Avoid using these references in your analysis.

## Why does this exist?
Mistakes happen and poor quality data makes it into GenBank. This can waste lots of your time to track down 
and the purpose of this list is so that you can share what you've found, so that others can avoid your mistakes.


## How do I appeal a decision?
Fix your genome and resubmit it to GenBank, then let us know.
